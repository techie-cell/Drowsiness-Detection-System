Drowsiness Detection System

The Drowsiness Detection System is a computer vision project that detects driver fatigue in real time using a webcam. The system analyzes eye movements, blinking patterns, and facial features to determine whether a person is becoming drowsy. If drowsiness is detected, an alert or alarm is triggered to prevent accidents.

This project aims to improve driver safety, reduce road accidents, and demonstrate how machine learning and OpenCV can be used for smart monitoring systems.
